### About Me

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Lee, an enthusiastic 3D printer based in Bartlett, Tennessee, a suburb of Memphis. My journey into the world of 3D printing began several years ago when I got my hands on a $300 Ender 3. Fueled by a desire for better print quality, I embarked on a series of upgrades â€“ from adding an extra z-axis to enhancing the mainboard and upgrading the extruder and hotend.

But that was just the beginning. I delved into the world of OctoPrint using a Raspberry Pi for remote monitoring and AI integration to detect potential failures. To boost print speed, I ventured into installing Klipper firmware, achieving not only faster prints but also efficient production.

My passion for 3D printing led me to discover a 3D printing company nearby. After dropping off my resume and cover letter, I eagerly monitored their online presence for job opportunities. Despite initial silence, perseverance paid off when I received an unexpected email for a "3D Printer Technical Support" role.

The interview process was a culmination of dedication, detailed preparation, and a touch of creativity. The discussions and tour fueled my excitement for the position. The journey unfolded with a heartfelt thank-you email, and, to my delight, I received a job offer.

Working at fbrc8 was an incredible experience. I absorbed knowledge from my coworkers, gaining insights into the intricacies of 3D printers and their systems. I discovered that both affordable and expensive machines face similar challenges because, at its core, 3D printing is about XYZ and E.

My time there was invaluable, but as the company closed its doors, a new chapter began for me. Now, I'm excited to continue my journey, armed with the skills and passion for 3D printing.

Feel free to reach out! ðŸš€
